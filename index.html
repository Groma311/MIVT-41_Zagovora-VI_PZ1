    <p>Dragon is a collective name uniting a number of mythical creatures appearing in myths and 
        folklore of many nations of the world.</p>
    <p>Let's talk about the main types of dragons that are more common than others:</p>


    <h2> Dragon (classic)</h2>
    <img width=350px src="img/Dragon.jpg">
    <p>Dragons are "standart" dragons with four legs and one pair of wings</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Amphitere</h2>
    <img width=350px src="img/Amphitere.jpg">
    <p>These dragons are a cross between a snake and a bird. They have a serpent’s body 
        from head to tail, and their wings (which look like bat wings) grow from their neck.<br>
        They may or may not have forelimbs, depending on the portrayal, but they never have hind limbs</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Drake</h2>
    <img width=350px src="img/drake.jpg">
    <p>Drake literally means “dragon” in Middle English. There are four limbs on this kind.
         Their bodies are hung low to the ground, with their bellies brushing the surface. <br>
          They resemble lizards in appearance, but they are considerably bigger.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Wyvern</h2>
    <img width=350px src="img/Wyvern.jpg">
    <p>These dragons are quite ferocious. They have a dragon’s head 
        (which is wedge-shaped like a crocodile’s), bat’s wings, and a long serpent’s tail. <br>
        They can have either lizard or avian legs.</p>
